**How to insert a custom poster on Plex**

The poster website of choice for this guide will be ThePosterDB (https://theposterdb.com/). You can use any poster website for this.

This can be done in order to be able to change the poster to reflect a different style, for either a collection or personal choice, or can be done in order to put a poster on one that imdb does not have.

For example, the movie I will be changing is Star Wars (1977) and changing it to this poster: https://theposterdb.com/poster/39586

1) Navigate to your Plex server library, which can be found at the top of the respective category of media under "Library"
